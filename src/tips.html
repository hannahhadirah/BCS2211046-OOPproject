        <h2>TIPS BEFORE HIKING</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Plan Your Route</h3>
                <p>Choose a hiking trail that matches your fitness level and experience. Research the trail length, 
                    elevation gain, terrain, and difficulty to ensure it's suitable for you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Check the Weather</h3>
                <p>Weather conditions can significantly impact your hike. Check the forecast for the area you'll be 
                    hiking in and dress accordingly. Also, be prepared for changes in weather, especially in mountainous regions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pack Essential Gear</h3>
                <p>Pack the necessary gear, including appropriate footwear, clothing layers, water, snacks, a first aid kit, 
                    navigation tools (map and compass or GPS), a flashlight or headlamp, sunscreen, insect repellent, and a multi-tool or knife.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                <p>Bring enough water to stay hydrated throughout the hike. A general rule of thumb is to drink about half 
                    a liter of water per hour of hiking. Consider carrying a water filtration system if you'll be hiking in areas with water sources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bring Snacks</h3>
                <p>Pack high-energy snacks to keep you fueled during the hike. Foods like trail mix, energy bars, nuts, 
                    and dried fruits are excellent options. Avoid foods that are heavy or difficult to digest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Inform Someone</h3>
                <p>Let a friend or family member know about your hiking plans, including your intended route and 
                    estimated return time. This ensures that someone knows where you are in case of an emergency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Start Early</h3>
                <p>Begin your hike early in the day, especially if you're tackling a longer trail or if the 
                    weather is expected to be hot. Starting early gives you more time to complete the hike and reduces the risk of hiking in extreme heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Follow Leave No Trace Principles</h3>
                <p>Practice Leave No Trace principles by minimizing your impact on the environment. 
                    Stay on designated trails, pack out all trash, respect wildlife, and avoid making excessive noise.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Be Prepared for Emergencies</h3>
                <p>Carry a fully charged cell phone (with emergency numbers programmed), a whistle, 
                    and a basic first aid kit. Know how to use the items in your first aid kit, and be prepared to handle common hiking injuries like blisters and minor cuts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Know Your Limits</h3>
                <p>Listen to your body and know your limits. Take breaks when needed, stay within your comfort zone, 
                    and turn back if the conditions become unsafe or if you're feeling exhausted.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
